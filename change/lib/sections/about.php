   <h4>Timing is everything!</h4>
        Coinschedule lists all the important dates in cryptocurrency projects. Whether you are already involved with Bitcoin or  other cryptocoins or just want to get into it, CoinSchedule is a resource to keep bookmarked. We lists the dates that matter: ICOs, crowdfunding, major milestones and conferences.<br>
        <br>
        We take information from various sources such as each coin's official website, forums, slack chats, newsletter and others and collate everything in an easy to digest format.<br><br><br>
        <h4>What is an ICO?</h4>
        ICO stands for <em>Initial Coin Offer</em> and it's typically used when a new cryptocoin project is launching. You can think of it as something equivalent to an IPO (<em>Initial Public Offering</em>) in the classic economy.<br>
        <br>
        ICO participants are usually required to send Bitcoin or other prominent cryptocoins to an address controlled by the ICO organisers, where the amount sent  determines how much of the new coin each participant will get. There have been several examples of individuals that become overnight millionaires by investing in ICOs, with some notable cases being NXT and Ethereum. Equally, there have been many cases that turned out to be scams, so it is important to be very careful when investing in ICOs.<br><br><br>
        <h4>Crowdfunding, Milestones and Events</h4>
        In addition to ICOs we also keep track of other crowdfunding events (note that all ICOs are crowdfunding, but not all crowdfunding are ICOs), major project milestones which are important as they can strongly influence a coin's market value and conferences where you can meet lots of likeminded invididuals, important people in the cryptocoin space and stay on top of the latest news and industry trends.<br><br>
